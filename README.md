# FPGA_mesh_system
This project implements an interactive digital system on an FPGA, integrating keyboard input, VGA display output, and serial UART communication. The design is modular, with each core functionality encapsulated in a dedicated VHDL entity. This repository contains the VHDL source code for these modules and their interconnections.
